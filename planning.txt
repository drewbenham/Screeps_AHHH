SPAWNING LOOP
============================

1. find if we can spawn (energy / already spawning)

2. find what we need to spawn and how many:

2. decide what is the most important to spawn. 
    priority:
        if hostiles present:
            defender
        else if low on resources and there currently is an open mining spot:
            harvester/miner.
        else if 

1: 
    if !spawner.spawning and energy > threshold:

2:
    # of miners = # of open mining spots (open containers)
    
    if # of upgraders < 1:
        needUpgrader = true
    
    if # of constructionsites  < 10 
        builders = 1;
    else 
        builders = # of constructionsites * 0.1 rounded down
